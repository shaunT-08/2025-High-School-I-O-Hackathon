Group Goal: Analyzing foods that are marketed as Healthy alternatives

1. Create a new spreadsheet that takes the items that are just marketed as healthy, place the other foods as unhealthy. (Done!)

| Nutrient          | Amount in Meal
| ----------------- | -------------- 
| **Calories**      | ~660 kcal      
| **Total Fat**     | ~25–27 g       
| **Saturated Fat** | ~5–6 g         
| **Trans Fat**     | 0 g           
| **Cholesterol**   | ~95 mg         
| **Sodium**        | ~700–750 mg    
| **Carbohydrates** | ~90–95 g       
| **Fiber**         | ~10–11 g       
| **Sugars**        | Mostly natural 
| **Added Sugars**  | 0–2 g          
| **Protein**       | ~33–35 g       
| **Vitamin A**     | ~320–350 mcg   
| **Vitamin C**     | ~60–70 mg      
| **Calcium**       | ~350–450 mg    

Heres a set of numbers(spaces indicate a new number):[660	234	26	5.5	0	95	725	92.5	10.5	20	30	335	65	400]. The set always needs to be 14 so I will give you other sets of numbers and for those sets find the %error from the set I gave you above(which is the theoretical) to the set I will give you later. Then, from those %errors you calculate find the average of those 14%errors. okay, just exclude the 5th data point from both the theoretical set and actual set when doing calculations
